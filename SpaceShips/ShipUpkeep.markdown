# Ship Upkeep

## Weekly Upkeep

Once per week, one Fuel is consumed by basic power generation, ship maintenance, and life support.

If upkeep is not maintained, roll a d6 for each skipped week and each of those Ship Malfunctions occur.

## Ship Malfunction

1.	**Dead In Space:** The ship totally shuts down and is helpless without a resupply.
2.	**Loss of Power:** The ship is on emergency power, all Specialty Modules are inoperable and all Core Modules operate as though damaged until resupply. 
3.	**Core Failure:** A random Core Module is [damaged](/SpaceShips/CoreModules.html#core-module-damage).
4.	**Module Failure:** A random Specialty Module is [damaged](/SpaceShips/SpecialtyModules.html#module-damage).
5.	**Targeting Errors:** All ship weapons are *impaired* until resupply or re-calibration.
6.	**Last Legs:** A random damaged Module is destroyed.
