# In System Travel

## Star Systems

Star systems are divided into separate Orbital Zones. A central Zone containing the system primaries, a four Zone inner ring, a six Zone middle ring, and an 8 Zone outer ring.

It takes 6 hours of travel to reach any point within the same Zone.

It takes 12 hours of travel to reach a neighboring Zone.

A Full Burn costs 1 Fuel and halves the travel time of a single trip. This can involve moving across multiple Zones in a single, continuous navigation without stops.

## Navigation

Roll a d6 after 12 hours spent navigating within a Zone, or when moving to a new Zone. 

* **1:** Encounter
* **2-3:** Nothing
* **4-6:** Zone Hazard

While under Full Burn roll two dice and keep the lower result. Hazard exposure is less likely, but being seen is more likely.

## Obstacles

Obstacles are static threats or navigational impairments. They are always encountered while traveling through the zone in which they exist.

Map key: â‡¥#

Obstacles include things like asteroid fields or electrically active nebula. 

## Hazards

Hazards are localized and spontaneous or irregular threats. A Hazard activates when the Navigation Roll result is a 4-6.

Map Key:  ðŸ—²#

Hazards include things like solar flares, corp sec patrols, or warp phenomena.

## Encounters

Encounters are system specific NPCs, ships, space creatures, or other phenomenon that could be encountered system wide. Each system has it's own random table of possible Encounters. A random encounter occurs if the Navigation Roll result is a 1.

## Example

![In-System Travel](ExampleSystem.png "Example In-System Travel")

The Space Beagle is traveling from **m4** to **i1**. Captain Vogt doesnâ€™t want to fly through the asteroid fields in **i2** and **i4** (â‡¥1) and has heard rumors of corporate patrols in **m3** (ðŸ—²1), so decides to travel through **c0** and risk solar flares (ðŸ—²2) from the unstable primary. Being low on Fuel, they travel under normal power, expecting the trip to take 48 hours.

In **i3** the GM rolls a 1 and rolls on the Encounter Table to find that a local science boat is requesting excess Fuel. The captain Comms his regrets and keeps moving. In **c0** the GM rolls a 3, letting the Beagle luckily dodge the solar flares. In **i1** the GM rolls a 5, but without a Hazard in that Zone the ship has completed its navigation without issue.
