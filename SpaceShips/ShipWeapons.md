# Ship Weapons

## Weapon Ranges

Weapons indicate the [engagement ranges](/SpaceShips/ShipCombat.html#range) in which they are effective. Some weapons have *charge* abilities which can be activated by spending 1 Fuel.

## Default Weapon

Most ships are armed with the default Phased Array weapon. Ships often carry one or more additional armaments.

Phased Array (1d6 Short/Medium) A standard microwave array mounted on most ships for self defense. With a clever operator can also be used for other applications such as slicing, mining, or heating.

## Specialty Armaments

1.	**Ion Cannons** (1d8, Short), does not damage Hull but disables a chosen Module on Direct Damage.
2.	**Forced Plasma** (1d8, Short/Medium), charge to fire a dispersed salvo (1d8 blast, Short/Medium).
3.	**Spinal Rail Gun** (1d10, Short/Medium/Long), can only fire in the direction the ship is pointing.
4.	**Grav Torpedo** (1d8, Medium/Long), ignores shields but hits the turn after being fired.
5.	**Auto Turret** (1d6, Short), Auto Fire Mode: automatically attacks the closest hostile target. Defense Mode: +1 Armor against any incoming attacks.
6.	**Mass Driver** (1d10, Short/Medium), takes a turn to fire, charge to fire immediately.
7.	**Nanobot Canisters** (1d6, Short), if this weapon deals Direct Damage it will deal that much Direct Damage again on the following round.
8.	**Superconducting Chaff** (1d10, Short), does not damage Hull but prevents Shields from being restored. If fired into empty space it creates a cloud that inhibits weapon fire (+3 Armor if firing through it).
9.	**Hostile Uplink** (1d6, Short/Medium), if this weapon deals Direct Damage it creates a data link to that shipâ€™s computer system allowing for hacking, data plundering, etc.
10.	**Powered Missiles** (1d6/1d8/1d10 at Short/Medium/Long), deals more damage the more distance it has to accelerate.
