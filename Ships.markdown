# Ships

## Space Ships Introduction

The intent for ship rules is to mirror the rules for individual characters. The players flying their space ship around a star system should feel similar to the players exploring an environment or diving into xeno ruins.

To that end the [In-System Travel](/SpaceShips/InSystemTravel.html) rules are designed to encourage a similar set of behaviors. Weighing the risks and rewards of getting close to things in order to find out more about them. Choosing which route to take to balance speed and safety. Moving slowly and carefully in order to avoid detection.

As with the rest of the game the mechanical logistics is kept to a minimum. Fuel does double duty acting both as an equivalent to Fatigue for activating abilities, as well as providing a pressure to visit places of civilization (or similar) without requiring detailed resource management.
