# NPC Ships

## Default Ship

When in doubt, an NPC ship has the following stats:

3 Shields, 0 Armor, a d6 Short/Medium weapon, 10 Hull, 10 Drive, 10 Tech.

Rather than listing specific Specialty Modules, NPC ships use “Tech” as being the Ability to roll for things the ship is designed to be good at.

Adjust stats for ships (or space creatures) that have notable or significant differences. Most of the time these can be differentiated by actions, motivations, and behavior rather than needing to adjust stats.

## Adjusting Stats

Difficult to damage ships have Armor, up to 3.

Deadly ships have stronger weapons, or multiple weapons and the necessary crew to operate them. 

Damage ranges from d6 for basic weapons, to d10 for devastating ones. Make sure to consider what ranges these weapons can properly operate within.

 * Durable or large ships have 15 Hull, fragile or small ships have 5.
 * Fast, maneuverable ships have 15 Drive, slow or awkward ships have 5.
 * Advanced, or specialist ships have 15 Tech, outdated or poorly maintained ships have 5.

Remember that there are NPCs piloting a ship or operating its weapons and Modules, and use their Abilities when necessary.

## Simple NPC Ships

Although NPC Ships can track Core Modules damage exactly as if it were a PC ship, this will usually be significantly more complexity and overhead than is necessary. 

Optionally use the following simplified system to reduce book keeping in combat:

When a ship takes Critical Damage, roll a d6:

**1-3:** Damaged. The ship still functions but its systems begin to fail and its weapons are impaired. If already damaged the ship becomes Incapacitated.

**4-5:** Incapacitated. The ship can do nothing but awkwardly maneuver and attempt repairs. If already Incapacitated, the ship is Destroyed.

**6:** Destroyed. The ship suffers catastrophic failure.

## Crew Ability

As a further simplification instead of tracking individual NPCs a single “Crew” ability can abstract the number and skills of individuals on the ship. 10 for an average ship, 5 for a ship crew which is poorly trained or understaffed, 15 for a plentiful and skillful crew.

## Example NPC Ships
