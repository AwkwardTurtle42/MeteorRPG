# Combat

## Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A round is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of turns.

## Actions

On your turn, you may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be: using an item, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, all players declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the GM calls for a Save for appropriate players or NPCs.

## Turns

The GM will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. If it’s unclear if you would act before your opponents, an appropriate Save will allow you to act first

## Attacking

When you attack, roll your weapon die and subtract your target’s armor, then deal the remaining total to their HP. 

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

## Modifiers

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), your attack is *impaired* and must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attack’s damage die.

If fighting from a position of strength (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), your attack is *enhanced*, and you roll 1d12 damage instead of your normal die.

## Dual Weapons

If you attack with more than one weapon at the same time, roll each damage die and keep the single highest result.

## Ganging Up

If multiple attackers target the same foe in a single Round, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

This applies both to player characters and non-player characters.

## Direct Damage

Damage that reduces your HP below zero deals Direct Damage to your Body for the amount remaining, and reduces it by that amount. 

## Critical Damage

If you take Direct Damage you must then make a Body Save to avoid Critical Damage. 

If you suffer Critical Damage you cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, you will stabilize. If left untreated, you die within the hour.

## Body Loss

If your Body is reduced to 0, you die.

## Morale Saves

Enemies must pass a Resolve Save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader’s Resolve in place of their own. Lone foes must Save when they’re reduced to 0 HP.

## Attack Tags

Attacks with the *blast* tag affect all targets in the appropriate area. This can be explosives, rapid-fire weapons, or even slashing alien claws.

Attacks with the *nonlethal* tag will not decrease Body when they reduce HP below zero, but still trigger a Body Save. If that Save fails, rather than taking Critical Damage you are unconscious and stable.
