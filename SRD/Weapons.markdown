# Weapons

## Weapon Tags

**Bulky** weapons take up two inventory slots, and require two hands to hold. 

**Blast** weapons deal damage to all targets within their effected area. 

**Nonlethal** weapons do not deal Direct Damage, but still trigger a Save to avoid Critical Damage.

## Weapon Descriptions

### Arc Projector (1d6 blast)

Originally a static electricity gun to remove dust from solar panels, but with the limiters removed it launches arcs of deadly electricity.

### Assault Rifle (1d10, bulky)

Big, loud, deadly.

### Cutting Torch (1d8) 

Emits a small, ultra-hot spear of flame which can cut through most materials.

### Demo Charge (1d10 blast)

A powerful plastic explosive satchel, triggered by a remote detonator.

### EMP Grenade (1d10 blast to electronics)

Releases a high powered electro-magnetic pulse which temporarily knocks out nearby electronics.

### Fire Extinguisher (d6)

Works decently well to bash someone over the head with. Otherwise sprays a sticky, fire retardant foam which hardens as it dries.

### Flamethrower (1d8 blast, bulky)

Most problems can be solved with the application of sufficient fire.

### Flashbang (1d10 blast, nonlethal)

Explodes in a loud, bright, multispectral blast which confuses both organic and electric eyes.

### Frag Grenades (1d10 Blast)

A one size fits all solution, as long as the problem is something being intact when you’d prefer it to be in pieces.

### Gyrojet Pistol (1d8)

Fires small, spinning rockets rather than dumb bullets. Sought more for style than function.

### Laser Wristwatch (1d6) 

A stylish, if somewhat gaudy, wristwatch with a hidden cutting laser.

### Machine Gun (1d8 blast, bulky)

Spray and pray. Although the praying is usually for those on the receiving end.

### Magnetic Slug Thrower (1d6)

Mostly silent, and popular for its ability to launch any bits of metal close to hand in a pinch.

### Mining Laser (1d10, bulky, one turn charge)

Despite its destructive power, the mining laser is largely considered unsuitable for combat due to the slow charge time, but needs must.

### Mono-molecular Sword (1d8)

Grown as a single super molecule, the blade is nearly indestructible and never loses its edge.

### Multipurpose Plasma Cutter (1d8) 

Fires a compressed blade of plasma for slicing. Emitters can be reconfigured on the fly to change the orientation of the plasma.

### Neuronic Whip (1d8, Nonlethal)

Fires a complex electro-magnetic pulse which triggers both the pain and pleasure centers of a brain, leading to confusion or unconsciousness. 

Irregular results when used on Synths or Xenos.

### Phased Microwave Array (1d8, nonlethal setting)

Invisible beams that scramble brains or fry them, depending on the setting. Commonly used to cook food in the field.

### Pipe Wrench (1d6)

Very useful for removing pipes, pretty useful for breaking bones.

### Plasma Projector (1d8, bulky)

Intended to clean organics off of surfaces, but with safety limiters released creates a short range cone of destructive plasa.

### Plastiform Pistol (1d8, jams on 8, invisible to scan)

A hand weapon made entirely of non-metallic scan transparent meta-materials, looks like a blurred cloud to the naked eye.

### Powered Sledgehammer (1d10, forceful, bulky)

The hammer’s head is built from a high durability piezo-electric crystal which releases stored energy on impact.

### Pry-bar (d6) 

Good for opening up stubborn doors, or skulls.

### Revolver (1d8)

A classic, with vacuum proofing being the only nod towards modernity.

### Rigging Gun (1d8, bulky, retractable harpoon)

Fires a harpoon with cable attached, popular for setting up safety lines between ships or derelict wrecks.

### Shock Dart Pistol (1d8, nonlethal)

Metallic prongs send high voltages through the target, effective against both flesh and electronics. 

### Syringe Launcher (1d6 or loaded syringe)

When someone needs medicine administered over there, but you’d really prefer to remain over here.

### Tactical Shotgun (1d6 blast, 1d10 point-blank, bulky)

Favored by Corporate Security, and disfavored by everyone else, for its ability to wreak absolute havoc inside an enclosed space ship.

### Timed Mining Charge (1d10 blast)

An explosive package designed to shatter close packed stone and metal.

### Welding Fuel Tank (d6 bludgeon, d10 blast if ignited)

Filled with fuel and oxygen for a welding torch, hefty in its own right.

### Welding Torch (1d8)

Burns with an ultra-hot flame to cut apart and stick together metals.
