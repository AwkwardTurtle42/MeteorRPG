# Augmentations

Augmentations are pieces of equipment that permanently fill an inventory slot when they’re installed into your body. Some Augmentations have *charge* abilities that are activated by adding Fatigue to an empty inventory slot.

## How To Get Augmentations

Gain a random Augmentation at character creation when you roll the minimum HP for your class. Otherwise gain them by paying top dollar at a high end licensed medical institute, doing a favor for the guy who runs a clinic behind Tony’s Space Bar, or saying yes to your Researcher buddy who asked if you’d be willing to help with a “little experiment” they’re working on.

Synths start with the special **Access Jack** augmentation, plus one more based on their starting HP.

**Access Jack:** Plug into and interface with any computer. *Charge* to remotely interface in line of sight. Special Augmentation which all Synths start with.
